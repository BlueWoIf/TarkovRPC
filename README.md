# TarkovRPC
Discord Rich Presence for Escape from Tarkov


Sidenote: It's pretty unfinished, read more about it below
# Disclaimer!
There is a 90% chance, that you are going to hate my code, and I know that feeling too!


I know how to search on StackOverFlow, and I can use CTRL+C and +V, so yeah, this is the result (not really).
# Usage
This project utilizes IronOCR (trial license, its expensive tho...), DiscordRPC, and Newtonsoft Json.


If you don't have an IronOCR license, you can only use it inside Visual Studio.


The screenshot function's coordinates are based on my 16:10 monitor on 1920x1200 resolution.


The Discord Application's ID is at the top, the current has map names, and some other icons, like usec, bear, etc. (all of them are in DiscordAppAssets/)


I left this project, because of the number of problems were increasing, and I couldn't fix them. (detailed below)
# Problems
First, if I want to use this outside VS, I would need the IronOCR license


Second, I don't know why, but Tarkov flags this program as a "Disallowed program", and while I didn't get banned by trying for over an hour, I don't know what other results will it have.


So, you are free to use this as a base for something, if you don't want to credit my name you don't need to, but if you got somewhere with this, feel free to message me on Discord (Wolf#4793), I'm looking forward to try it if it's really working! :)


Also, if you want to pull request to this repo by any chance, you are free to do it!
